# Scala_exercises_notebooks
This repo contains Jupyter notebooks with several programming exercises that I am using to learn the Scala language.

You will find one or more solutions for each exercise and you can add new sotlutions that use different techniques and/or methods from the ones already present.

The exercises used here can be found on https://www.w3resource.com/scala-exercises/index.php, and you are invited to submit them new problems in your preferred technologies in order to help the initiative.
