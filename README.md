# Learning Scala: Jupyter Noterbooks with Problems and Solutions
This repo contains Jupyter notebooks with several programming exercises that I am using to learn the Scala language. Even though I am using it to learn Scala, you ca use it to learn or refresh the basics of the language of your choice.

You will find one or more solutions for each exercise and you can add new sotlutions that use different techniques and/or methods from the ones already present.

The exercises used here can be found on https://www.w3resource.com/scala-exercises/index.php, and you are invited to submit them new problems in your preferred technologies in order to help the initiative.
